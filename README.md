The user can then get directions to the various visitor centers of the park. Find hikes that are within the park based off the difficulty of the hikes. The user can sign in to the site and save hikes that they wish to complete or to add hikes that they have already completed. If the user looks for the other sites that fall under the parks service then it will display basic information about those sites.
